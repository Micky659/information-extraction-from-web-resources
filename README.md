# information-extraction-from-web-resources

Developed and executed a project focused on Information Extraction (IE) within the context of a hands-on seminar module in my university. Applied concepts and techniques to automatically extract information from natural language texts, emphasizing knowledge base (KB) population for modern artificial intelligence systems. Led the design and implementation of an Information Extraction (IE) pipeline using spaCy, a state-of-the-art NLP Python library, addressing fundamental challenges in natural language processing (NLP). Acquired practical experience in web scraping, utilizing the Twitter API, creating NLP datasets, leveraging pre-trained machine learning models, and training spaCy's machine learning models. Successfully populated a domain-specific knowledge graph (KG) using Neo4j AuraDB, a leading graph database on the cloud.
